Tally XML Import Samples (GST-era only)
======================================
Files:
- Tally_Sales_Sample_Import.xml      (50 Sales vouchers, Jul 2017 onward)
- Tally_Purchases_Sample_Import.xml  (50 Purchase vouchers, Jul 2017 onward)

How to Use:
1. Open Tally ERP 9 in the company with GST enabled (Karnataka 29).
2. Ensure the following ledgers exist (exact names):
   - Sales - Domestic, Sales - Interstate
   - Purchase - Domestic, Purchase - Interstate
   - Output CGST, Output SGST, Output IGST
   - Input CGST, Input SGST, Input IGST
   - All party ledgers referenced in the XML (create via Ledgers_All.csv if needed).
   - Stock items and units as per Stock_Items.csv and Units.csv.
3. From Gateway of Tally: Import of Data → Vouchers → select the XML file.
4. Review a few imported vouchers to confirm taxes and amounts.
5. Pre-GST (Apr–Jun 2017) vouchers use VAT/CST and are NOT included here; those would need a different template.

Notes:
- These samples use a single inventory line per voucher and a simplified base amount logic (Taxable + Freight + Round Off).
- If your Tally has different ledger names, edit the XML <LEDGERNAME> values accordingly.
